HAPPY 
You will be blessed with a beautiful cat
You did well, have some candy from a suspicious van
You will get cat cuddles
There are better days to come
Slay the day away <3
Its okay if they don’t like you not everyone has good taste

SAD 
Tomorrow will be a better day

Maybe you just need a high five to the face
Be happy eat a bug
Life is sweeter with you in it
Why are you here? Go see a therapist
ANGRY 
Remember to calm down and reevaluate your life
I recommend some warm tea or a punching some rice
Take some deep breaths
Get some fresh air!
If you feel angry just don’t straight up
Think happy thoughts like a calm sea breeze on your feet
It’s not worth it calm down
Go on a walk
RANDOM
Tomorrow will be a worse day
You are my 13th reason
It's all in your head
Somethings just happen
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP
